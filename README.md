### ProTree_pipe.sh

ProTree is a simple (and not very clever!) automated pipeline for generating phylogenetic trees based on protein data sets.

It should suit quick and simple phylogenetic inferences without much input, however if there are any desired modifications,
you may do so within this script at their respective command.

The script should be run within a directory containing desired protein fastas (labelled with '.faa' suffix).

### to do!

1. fix the tar'ing of final working directory.
2. allow continuing from specific steps, rather than re-do pipeline all over again.
